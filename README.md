# Employee-Tracker

GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlfitz2/Employee-Tracker

This Employee Tracker allows the user to make requests of the database through the terminal in order to view or update the information pertaining to the company's employees. Each employee has a job title, manager (who is also an employee), and their job is assigned to a particular department. The user can view tables showing the employees, roles or departments and the information that is tied to these. They can also add new employees, departments or roles along with the relevant information for each one. 

The application uses MySQL, Node and Express to allow the user to interact with the data through the terminal, and the functionality is built with JavaScript and .SQL files.
